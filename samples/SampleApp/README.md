# SampleApp

This small sample demonstrates using the local `FileEventStore` with DI, appending an event and reading it back.

Run:
```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run --project samples/SampleApp/SampleApp.csproj
```

Add to solution:
```bash
dotnet sln add samples/SampleApp/SampleApp.csproj
```
